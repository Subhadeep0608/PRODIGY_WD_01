            The Taj Mahal, an iconic symbol of love, was commissioned by Emperor
            Shah Jahan in 1632 in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Built on the
            banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, this white marble mausoleum is
            renowned for its intricate carvings and inlaid gemstones, showcasing
            exquisite Mughal architecture. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is
            surrounded by lush gardens, fountains, and reflecting pools that
            enhance its breathtaking beauty. The harmonious blend of Persian,
            Islamic, and Indian architectural elements makes it a masterpiece of
            global heritage. The Taj Mahal attracts millions of visitors
            annually, who are mesmerized by its changing hues during sunrise and
            sunset. It stands not only as a symbol of eternal love but also as a
            testament to the architectural brilliance of the Mughal era.

          <p class="para">
            The Qutub Minar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a towering minaret
            in Delhi that exemplifies Indo-Islamic architecture. Built in 1193
            by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, it was later completed by his successors,
            including Iltutmish and Firoz Shah Tughlaq. Standing at 73 meters
            tall, it is constructed from red sandstone and marble, featuring
            intricate carvings of verses from the Quran. The surrounding Qutub
            Complex includes historical structures like the Quwwat-ul-Islam
            Mosque and the Iron Pillar, which is famous for its rust-resistant
            composition. The Qutub Minar is a symbol of India's rich historical
            tapestry, attracting history enthusiasts and tourists alike. Its
            soaring structure reflects the ambition and craftsmanship of the
            early Delhi Sultanate.

          <p class="para">
            Hampi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, was once the capital of the
            Vijayanagara Empire and is located in Karnataka. Known for its
            sprawling ruins and historical significance, it is home to numerous
            temples, palaces, and ancient markets. The Virupaksha Temple, a
            living shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva, stands as a centerpiece
            amidst the boulder-strewn landscape. The intricate stone carvings of
            the Vittala Temple, including the iconic stone chariot, exemplify
            the architectural grandeur of the Vijayanagara period. Hampi is a
            blend of history and natural beauty, drawing visitors with its
            surreal landscape, vibrant history, and spiritual ambiance. It
            continues to be a treasure trove for archaeologists, historians, and
            travelers.
